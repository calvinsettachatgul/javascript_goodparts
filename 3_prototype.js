// every object is linked to a prototype from which it can inherit properties.

// when you make a new object you can select the object that should be its prototype

// the mech Javascript provides to do this is messy and complex but it can be significantly simplified

// add a create emthod to the Object function


//prototype link has no effect on updating when we make changes to an object the objet's prototyepe is not touched:
 

// delegation

/// dynamic relationship

// if we add a new property to a prototype that property will immed be visible in all of the objects that are based on that prototype

// more about the prototype chain in CH6
